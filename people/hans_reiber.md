## Introduction
Johan H.C. Reiber received his M.Sc. EE-degree from the Delft  University of Technology in 1971 and his M.Sc and Ph.D. from Stanford  University, USA in 1975 and 1976, respectively. In 1977, he founded the  Division of Image Processing (LKEB) at the Thoraxcenter, Erasmus  University in Rotterdam, and continued these activities from 1990 at the Department of Radiology, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands. Since 1995 he has been Professor of Medical Image Processing at the LUMC, and from 1995 until 2005 also a professor of  cardiovascular imaging at the Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of  the Netherlands (ICIN) in Utrecht. In 2000 he became a member of the  Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), Physics faculty, section Technical Sciences.

He is (co)-author of more than 625 scientific papers, and  co-author/editor of 15 books. He is editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Cardiovascular Imaging, and serves on the Editorial Board of several other journals. In 2004 he became an IEEE Fellow for his  contributions to medical image analysis and its applications. Other  fellowships include those of the European Society of Cardiology (1988) and the American College of Cardiology (2010).

He is also co-founder and CEO of Medis medical imaging systems in  Leiden, a global provider of software packages for the quantitative analysis of medical images, in particular of the cardiovascular system.
