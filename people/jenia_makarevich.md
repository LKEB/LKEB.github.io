##  Introduction
Jenia Makarevich is a PhD candidate in the Division of Image Processing (LKEB). Her research focuses on predicting tumour growth and developing models for future tumour volume estimation of vestibular schwannoma. By analysing longitudinal MRI data, she aims to characterise individual tumour dynamics over time. The final goal of her work is to create a tool that enables clinicians to optimise follow-up imaging schedules based on predicted tumour progression.

Jenia earned her MSc in Artificial Intelligence for Health from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2024 and her BSc in Econometrics from Belarusian State University.

Beyond her research, Jenia serves as Treasurer on the board of the LUMC Association of PhD Candidates ([LAP LUMC](https://www.laplumc.org/)), where she also enjoys organising community and academic events. In her free time, she enjoys open water swimming and knitting.
