I am Donghang Lyu. My research is about using AI methods to accelerate 4D cardiac MRI by integrating some info like motion to improve image quality.

I got my bachelorâ€™s degree of communication engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2020. After that, I worked in the domestic company for one year due to covid.

I came to Leiden University for my master study and got the degree of computer science in 2023.

My area of interests are mainly deep learning, computer vision and cardiac MRI processing.
