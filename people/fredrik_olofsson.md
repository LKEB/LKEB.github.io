## Introduction
Fredrik Olofsson is originally from Sweden and is doing a PhD in Machine Learning at the Department of Radiology, Division of Image Processing (LKEB), Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). 
His PhD topic is **“Improving early detection of pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals through artificial intelligence methods.”**. 
The project is a joint collaboration between the Departments of Gastroenterology and Radiology, supervised by Jeanin E. van Hooft and Jouke Dijkstra. 
He comes from an engineering background in Chemical Engineering and completed his master’s thesis in physics on X-ray imaging and reconstruction with machine learning algorithms at Lund University in Sweden.

He sees his future in AI applied to interdisciplinary sciences such as healthcare, biology, chemistry, and physics. He enjoys collaborating across disciplines to push collective understanding and drive larger projects towards common goals that require multiple areas of expertise.
