# Pulmonary & Musculoskeletal Imaging

Section leader: Dr. B.C. Stoel

This section is primary engaged in image processing for applications in Pulmonology and Musculoskeletal Imaging (PMI) in close collaboration with the corresponding clinical departments at the LUMC, including Orthopaedics and Rheumatology.

The pulmonary applications are focused on the quantification of lung diseases, such as pulmonary emphysema and interstitial lung disease, using CT densitometry and automatic detection and assessment of bronchial and vascular structures, as well as deep learning based scoring.

The orthopaedic applications involve projects, in which the micro-motion of endoprostheses are measured and in which the optimal allograft is selected automatically.

Together with Rheumatology, our research is focused on deep learning based detection of early rheumatoid arthritis an its progression in MRI of the hands and feet.
