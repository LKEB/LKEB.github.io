# Imaging Genetics

Section Leader: Prof. dr. ir. Boudewijn P.F. Lelieveldt

The Imaging Genetics section focuses on developing methods to analyze high-dimensional molecular data across different spatial scales to produce new insights about structural and functional organization of tissues. Our aim is to discover associations between single-cell and multiplexed spatial observations.  We develop computational algorithms and visual analytics technologies to cross-link imaging data and high-throughput “omics” data through spatially-localized molecular data, such as atlases of the Allen Institute for Brain Science.
