# Cardiac Image Analysis

Magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used for the evaluation of the cardiovascular system. Often, during a cardiac MR examination multiple scan techniques are applied in order to assess several morphological and functional aspects resulting in a huge amount of images obtained in a single imaging session. MRI is highly suited for quantitative evaluation of the cardiac or vascular status of the patient. The research in the MRI section focuses at the development of new automated quantitative image analysis methods for these cardiovascular MR imaging studies.

Currently, the research is in the following areas:
1. new contour detection techniques for the detection of the left and right ventricular boundaries.
2. segmentation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Angiography and vessel wall MRI studies.
3. new techniques for the assessment of trans-valvular flow and ventricular wall motion using velocity-encoded MRI.
4. fluid dynamic modeling approaches to assess the flow distribution in carotid arteries.
5. new techniques for accurate quantification of functional ventricular parameters.

## Software
Several of the image analysis software algorithms that were developed within our group have been transferred to industry for integration into commercially available clinical end products. Additionally, research software tools developed within the team are widely used in clinical research by numerous national and international centers. Software tools have been developed enabling rapid development of dedicated deep learning models for a specific type of imaging data. Imaging data from large cohort studies can be fully automatically processed using mode processing. The close interaction with research groups often results in opportunities for new research projects granted by national or international funding agencies.
