The Division of Image Processing, in Dutch abbreviated as the LKEB (Laboratorium voor Klinische en Experimentele Beeldverwerking), is a research group within the Department of Radiology, LUMC. The director of LKEB is Prof. [Boudewijn P.F. Lelieveldt PhD](https://lkeb.lumc.nl/portfolio/boudewijn/).

We perform fundamental and applied research in the area of biomedical image processing and analysis. We execute extensive validation studies of the developed techniques, both technically and clinically. We aim to impact the healthcare system by bringing research results close to the clinic, through collaboration with clinicians as well as with industry. While most of our research focuses on medical imaging, we are also interested in biological and genetic data. We have worked in particular on CT, MRI, IVUS and OCT imaging, in the brain, chest, heart, abdomen, vasculature and bones. In addition, we investigate highly heterogeneous data such as omics, imaging and mass-spectrometry combined, e.g. to produce new insights about structural and functional organization of the brain.

Methodologically we develop artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies such as deep learning. We combine these with general computer science methods and mathematical modeling. Our work encompasses segmentation, registration, quantification, visualization, radiomics, etc. To bring our research results close to a clinical end-user we develop high quality software. Our scientific programmers therefore work through a formalized Software Development Process (SDP), often in close collaboration with industry, in particular with Medis medical imaging systems BV. This has led to a number of commercially successful products, and spinoff to a number of large medical imaging vendors. The open source image registration software elastix is also maintained at LKEB.
